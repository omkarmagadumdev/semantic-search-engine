# Semantic Search Engine with HNSW and RAG

A fully working **Semantic Search Engine** built with JavaScript/Node.js and a web UI.  
Implements **HNSW**, **KD-Tree**, and **Brute Force** search algorithms side-by-side, plus a **RAG pipeline** powered by a local LLM via Ollama.

> Built as an educational project to show how production vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma actually work under the hood.

## What This Project Does

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **3 Search Algorithms** | HNSW (production-grade), KD-Tree, Brute Force — run all three and compare speed |
| **3 Distance Metrics** | Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance |
| **16D Demo Vectors** | 20 pre-loaded semantic vectors across 4 categories (CS, Math, Food, Sports) |
| **2D PCA Scatter Plot** | Live visualization of semantic space — watch clusters form |
| **Real Document Embedding** | Paste any text → Ollama embeds it with `nomic-embed-text` (768D) |
| **RAG Pipeline** | Ask questions about your documents → HNSW retrieves context → local LLM answers |
| **Full REST API** | CRUD endpoints: insert, delete, search, benchmark, hnsw-info |

```

**HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** is the same algorithm used by Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, and Milvus. It builds a multilayer graph where each layer is progressively sparser — searches start at the top layer and zoom in, achieving O(log N) complexity instead of O(N) for brute force.

---

## Prerequisites

You need **3 things** installed:

1. **Node.js 18+**
2. **Git**
3. **Ollama** (runs the local AI models)

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1 — Install Node.js

1. Install **Node.js 18+** from **https://nodejs.org**
2. Verify:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

---

### Step 2 — Install Git

1. Go to **https://git-scm.com/download/win** and download Git for Windows
2. Run the installer with default settings
3. Verify:
```
git --version
```

---

### Step 3 — Install Ollama (Local AI Models)

1. Install Ollama from **https://ollama.com**
2. Start Ollama:

```bash
ollama serve
```

3. In another terminal, pull the two required models:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```
*(~274 MB — this is the embedding model)*

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```
*(~2 GB — this is the language model)*

4. Verify Ollama is running:
```bash
ollama list
```
You should see both models listed.

> **Minimum specs for Ollama:** 8GB RAM recommended. The models will use ~3GB total.

---

### Step 4 — Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:omkarmagadumdev/semantic-search-engine.git
cd semantic-search-engine
```

*(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the actual GitHub username)*

---

### Step 5 — Install Dependencies

Inside the project folder, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs the Express backend and frontend dependencies.

> **Troubleshooting:**
> - `npm: command not found` → Node.js is not installed correctly
> - install errors → delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again

---

### Step 6 — Run Everything

**Terminal 1** — Start Ollama:
```bash
ollama serve
```

**Terminal 2** — Start the app server:
```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
=== Semantic Search Engine ===
http://localhost:8080
20 demo vectors | 16 dims | HNSW+KD-Tree+BruteForce
Ollama: ONLINE
  embed model: nomic-embed-text  gen model: llama3.2
```

**Open your browser** and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Using the Application

### Tab 1: Search (Demo Vectors)

- Type any concept in the search box: `binary tree`, `sushi`, `basketball`, `calculus`
- Choose your algorithm: **HNSW**, **KD-Tree**, or **Brute Force**
- Choose distance metric: **Cosine**, **Euclidean**, or **Manhattan**
- Click **⚡ SEARCH** — results appear with distances, the matching point glows on the scatter plot
- Click **▶ COMPARE ALL ALGOS** to run all 3 algorithms and compare their speed

**The scatter plot** shows all 20 vectors projected to 2D using PCA. Notice how the 4 semantic categories (CS, Math, Food, Sports) form distinct clusters — this is what "semantic similarity" looks like visually.

### Tab 2: Documents (Real Embeddings)

This uses Ollama to generate **real 768-dimensional embeddings** from any text.

1. Type a title (e.g., `Operating Systems Notes`)
2. Paste any text — lecture notes, textbook paragraphs, Wikipedia articles
3. Click **⚡ EMBED & INSERT**
4. Long documents are automatically split into overlapping 250-word chunks
5. Each chunk gets its own embedding and is stored in a separate HNSW index

### Tab 3: Ask AI (RAG Pipeline)

1. Make sure you have inserted some documents in Tab 2 first
2. Type a question about your documents
3. Click **🤖 ASK AI**

What happens behind the scenes:
```
1. Your question → embedded with nomic-embed-text (768D vector)
2. HNSW search → finds 3 most semantically similar chunks
3. Retrieved chunks → sent as context to llama3.2
4. llama3.2 → generates an answer based only on your documents
```

The answer streams in with a typewriter effect. Click the **context chips** to see exactly which chunks the AI used.

## Algorithm Deep Dive

### HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)

Nodes are inserted into a multilayer graph. Each node randomly gets assigned a maximum layer. Layer 0 has all nodes with many connections; higher layers have fewer nodes (exponentially fewer) with longer-range connections.

**Insert:** Start at the top layer, greedily find the nearest node, drop a layer, repeat. At each layer from your assigned max down to 0, run a beam search (ef_construction=200) and connect to the M nearest neighbors bidirectionally.

**Search:** Same greedy descent from top layer. At layer 0, expand to ef nearest candidates using a priority queue.

**Why it's fast:** The upper layers act like a highway — you quickly get to the right neighborhood, then zoom in at layer 0.

### KD-Tree (K-Dimensional Tree)

Binary space partitioning. Each node splits space along one dimension (cycling through all dimensions). Search prunes entire subtrees when the closest possible point in that subtree can't beat the current best — the "ball within hyperslab" check.

**Weakness:** Degrades with high dimensions (curse of dimensionality). Works well for ≤20D, becomes close to brute force at 768D.

### Why HNSW Wins at High Dimensions

KD-Tree pruning relies on axis-aligned distance bounds. In high dimensions, almost all the space is near the boundary of the hypersphere — no subtrees get pruned. HNSW's graph-based approach doesn't have this problem.

## Common Issues

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Ollama: OFFLINE` in header | Run `ollama serve` in a terminal |
| Embedding takes forever | Ollama is downloading the model on first use, wait 2 min |
| `npm: command not found` | Install Node.js 18+ and reopen the terminal |
| Port 8080 already in use | Kill the process using port 8080, then restart `npm start` |
| LLM answer is slow | Normal — llama3.2 takes 10–30s on a laptop CPU. Use llama3.2:1b for faster answers |

### Use a Smaller/Faster LLM

If llama3.2 is too slow on your laptop, switch to the 1B model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

Then edit `src/services/ollamaService.js` where `genModel` is set:
```js
this.genModel = 'llama3.2:1b';
```
Restart the server after changing it.
